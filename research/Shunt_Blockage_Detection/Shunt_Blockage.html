	  <p class="left">
	    During the 2016 to 2017 school year, I had the privilege of conducting medical research on determining the functional states of implanted medical shunt via an optical method. This was a senior design project and I worked as part of a team of four undergraduate students. I will discuss the key concepts and methodology of this research project.
	  </p>
	  <p class="left">
	    Given that patients with Hydrocephalus usually have pressure or flow regulated medical shunt implantions which aid in the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid out of the ventricles of the brain and into the peritoneal cavity surrounding the abdomen, blockage of this flow will nullify the effect of shunt implants. Based on published work using ultrasound to detect blockages in venticuloperitonial shunt, we sought to establish on optical method of shunt function detection using a Michelson interferometer.
	  </p>
	  
	  <a name="Physiological_Flow"></a><h2 class="content">Physiological Flow Conditions</h2>
	  <p class="left">
      Cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the ventricles of the brain and is reabsorbed by surrounding tissue and replaced every 6-7 hours. Just as pressure differentials created by the heart regulate the flow of blood, pressure differentials also regulate cerebrospinal fluid. The pumping of the heart also affects the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. One of the drivers of CSF is the pulsating beats of the heart, this pulsation is 45-120 beats/min and translates to 0.75-2.0Hz. The pressure of CSF ranges from 160mmH20 to 230mmH20 and the fluid has a flow rate of 25-29 ml/hr. 
	  </p>
	
	  <p class="left">
      Hydrocephalus affects an estimated one in 500 newborn babies. It is a condition in which the individual has an unusually high accumulation of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) in the brain. It eventually causes a pressure build up that can have a number of dangerous side effects from discomfort to damage in brain functionality. The normal volume of CSF in an adult brain is roughly 20 ml, whereas in a patient with hydrocephalus, the total volume of CSF is roughly 120 to 150 ml. Hydrocephalus is caused by a series of complications. A common cause is by the unequal enlargement of ventricles, tumors, blood clots, or trapped ventricles due to the foramen of Monroe. Typically, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are used to scan and determine if a patient has hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a treatable condition.  In order to treat hydrocephalus, a shunt must be surgically implanted.

	  <figure>

	    <figcaption>Figure 1: The ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VP) consists of four main parts. The ventricular/proximal catheter, the shunt reservoir, the valve which opens as pressure in the reservoir reaches a certain threshold, and the distal catheter in which fluid leaves the valve into.</figcaption>
	  </figure>
    
	  <p class="left"><br>
	    The most common method for handling hydrocephalus is the surgical insertion of a shunt behind the ear of the patient as seen in Figure 1.  The shunt is connected to tubing that runs under the skin, down the patient’s back and towards the base of the spine.  This mechanism allows the CSF to drain continuously throughout the patient's day.  Though the current solution is very effective, any such device inserted in the patient's body runs the risk of getting blocked.  Given that CSF moves extremely slowly, on the scale of mL/day, visual examination of the shunt via MRI or similar is insufficient to tell if a blockage has occurred. Current methods of detecting blockages are invasive and inefficient.
    </p>
    
	  <p class="left">
	    In all shunts, there are four main components: a proximal catheter, reservoir, valve, and distal catheter. As CSF flows through the proximal catheter, which is attached to the brain ventricles, it passes through the reservoir and valve of the shunt, and through the distal catheter towards the body cavity. There are two main types of shunts: the ventriculo-peritoneal shunt (VP) and the ventriculo-atrial shunt (VA).  In VP shunts, CSF is transported from the lateral ventricles of the brain and into the peritoneum, which is located in the abdomen. VA shunts are used to transport CSF from the cerebral ventricular system towards the atrium of the heart. In particular to this project, the focus will be on the functionality of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
    </p>
    
	  <a name="Ultrasound_to_Doppler"></a><h2 class="content">Laser Doppler Testing</h2>
	  <p class="left">
	    Numerous methods to monitor shunt function have been proposed. In particular, ultrasound imaging has been used on the pressure-valve shunt to determine shunt function and the presence of blockages.  The transducer of the ultrasound machine is “longitudinally placed above the valve, and then oriented transversely to observe the valve cross-section”. Using the M-mode of the ultrasound, a cumulative sum of the phase shift of the valve is calculated which results in a signal. Based on the signal’s characteristics through frequency domain analysis, it is able to see if the shunt is performing normally or if there are obstructions at either the proximal or distal catheter locations. Although proximal and distal blockages could be seen and monitored through ultrasound imaging, the time it takes to find the proper placement of the transducer on the valve proves to be a setback, as well as the reproducibility of the data due to the changing location of the transducer on top of the valve.

	  </figure>

	  <p class="left"><br>
	    We were able to determine the plausibility of creating an optical method for shunt function detection by testing the LDV on our system simulating the pulsatile flow of CSF through the shunt, which is regulated by the beating of the heart. Preliminary research using the Moor Blood Flow Laser Doppler has shown that it can detect shunt function and show obstructions (proximal or distal) in a time efficient and reproducible manner, and this has been proven in the Ultrasound Imaging Labs at Krasnow Institute of George Mason University. Cerebrospinal fluid flows as pulses in accordance with the cardiac cycle as it passes through the ventricles. By using Laser Doppler, the flow of CSF can be determined through the ventricles, through the valve, and out to the distal catheter. In Figure two, sysnthetic skin is placed over the shunt valve. this is necessary for the light beam to remain focused on its way back to the LDV's detection system. Notice in Figure 3 that the operation of the LDV without the skin allows for no signal to be received because of the difracted light with passes through the transparent shunt. The opacity and smoothness of the skin allows for light to return to the LDV smoothly.

    <p class="left"><br>
	    A laser Doppler Vibrometer may be simplified to a Michelson interferometer to the extent that both methods require optical inteerference be detected by a sensor. Both methods rely on the sumation of energies coming from bothe a refernce beam and the beam returning from the sample. As can be seen in the image above, the Michelson interferometer has two major arms. one arm is in the direction of a reference beam which reflects from a stationary mirror while the other arm is in the direction of the sample. In our case we first experimented with a piezo electric chip and so the image syas test bed. The individual energies of each arm of an interferometer can be given by the equation:
      \[ E_{1} = E_{01}sin(kL_{1} + \omega t) \]
      where \( E_{1} \) is the final light energy of an emitted photon, \( E_{01} \) is the initial light energy of the photon. \( L_{1} \) is the fixed distance from the beam splitter to the mirror, \( k \) is the wave number, \( \omega \) is the angular frequency and \( t \) is time. A second photon coming from the sample also follows the same equation:
      \[ E_{2} = E_{02}sin(kL_{2} + \omega t) \]
      where the values correspond the the equivalent values of the first arm, except \( L_{2} \) is generally a term which oscillates over time. the terms \( E_{1} \) and \( E_{2} \) are generalized and may be rplaceed for \( I_{1} \) and \( I_{2} \) when talking about intesity as opposed to energy. To calculate total energy, one would simply sum the two terms and attain the following equation:
      \[ I_{3} = I_{1} + I_{2} \]
      In reality, this is a sum of complex terms which, when expressed as a sum of sinusoids turns out to be 
      \[ I_{3} = I_{1} + I_{2} + 2\sqrt{I_{1}I_{2}} cos({2\pi(L_{1} - L_{2})}/\lambda) \]

	  </figure>

	  <p class="left"><br>
	    According to the principles of interferometry as described above, both constructive and destructive interference occurs as the intensities of the two sets of photons interact with one another. When the two arms of the interferometer are perfectly orthogonal, there is an equal amount of constructive and destructive interferences occuring as photons which are in phase and out of phase with one another interact. In the case of constructive interference, photons interact to form a higher intensity light beam while in the case of destructive interference, the intensities cancel one another out. This can be seen in the image of Firgure 6. Here the bright fringes correspond to constructive interference while the darker fringes correspond to destructive interference.

	  </figure>

    <p class="left"><br>
	    The LDV, which we used for testing is deceiving in that it employs the basic principles of interfereometry, with an addition of the principle of a doppler shift. The LDV makes use of an Acousto Optic Modulator of a Bragg Cell which is used to modulate the frequency of a light beam by passing the beam through an oscillating piece of quarts at a given frequency. As one can see from the schematic the frequency \( f_{o} \) of the laser is split by a beam splitter, one beam becomes the referenc ebeam while the other becomes the sample beam. This beam is passed through a Bragg cell which alters the beam frequency by adding an extra \( f_{b} \) term which them sums with the frequency of the target, adding and \( f_{d} \) term before recombining with the initial reference where the difference in frequency is detected.

	    For this experiment, a basic Michelson interferometer was built and was successfully able to differentiate between the three different stages of shunt function and disfunction. The interferometer consisted of Collimated Laser Diode Module, 532 nm, 4.5 mW, Round Beam, which was bought from thorlabs and a piezo electric chip, also acquired from thorlabs was used as a test bed to determine the sensitivity of our method. We were able to detect 2.4 micron displacements from the piezo chip. DAQ was carried out on a Lecroy oscilloscope using LABVIEW software to stream data while analysis was done on MATLAB. A 15 mm plano convex lens was also used to focus the light beam as wellas to attain spherical fringe patterns.

	  <p class="left"><br>
	    The first undertaking by the team was to create a hydrostatic pressure pump that would take advantage of gravity to create physiological flow conditions of a 1Hz cycle. To do this a pump was greated with an adjustable arm length and a multi-frequency switch. Whe ended up using the maximum arm length of ~6 to 7 inches. The pump was controlled by a motor which we connected to a 5 volt DC power supply.</p>
    </p>
    
	  <a name="Flow_Detection"></a><h2 class="content">Flow Condition Detection</h2>
	  <p class="left">
	    The first test was to detect normal flow. This was done through peak displacement detection in which the peaks needed to fit into the 0.8-0.9 Hz frequency of pulses. To enhance the signal, fluid was pushed through the the VP shunt at around twice the physiological flow and a mirror was attached to the surface of the shunt to better reflect the laser beam back into the interferometer, maximizing the interference.
    </p>

	    <figcaption>Figure 10: Normal flow condition as detected by our interferometer.</figcaption>
	  </figure>
    
	  <p class="left"><br>
	    8 trials of Test 3 were performed. Each trial of normal flow with the photodiode was recorded for 50 seconds.  The signal was filtered initially by a low-pass butterworth filter before it reached the data acquisition system.  This initial signal seemed to show a periodic nature on the oscilloscope with no additional analysis, a good sign.  To better detect the peaks, the results were sent out from the oscilloscope and analyzed in the 8 trials were averaged for an overall mean peak in normal flow of 0.63 Volts. No blockages were induced for this test.
    </p>

	    <figcaption>Figure 11: Blockage condition of proximal catheter and reduced flow condition as detected by our interferometer.</figcaption>
	  </figure>
	  
	  <p class="left"><br>
	    With positive results for normal flow, the next test was to induce proximal blockages.  All initial filtering and analysis were kept the same as in Test 3.  Immediately, a dramatic fall in voltage peaks was observed on the oscilloscope.  This strongly supported the requirement of being able to detect a proximal blockage and differentiate it from normal flow.  Similar to Test 3, 8 trials were recorded.  For each trial, proximal blockage was induced after 10 seconds of normal flow and maintained for the remaining 40 seconds. The results of all 8 trials were averaged to generate a mean peak voltage during proximal blockage of 0.49 Volts.  Proximal blockage shows no fluid flowing through the shunt reservoir as there is is a blockage induced at the proximal catheter end.  Figure 7 reflects that behavior.
    </p>

	  </figure>
    
	  <p class="left"><br>
	    For the final test, 16 trials of distal blockage were performed on the shunt. Similar to Test 4, the distal blockage was induced at 10 seconds and the remaining 40 seconds was distally blocked. The same initial filtering was performed as with Tests 3 and 4. The difference in behavior was less obvious initially for the distal blockage peaks compared to the proximal blockage peaks.  Instead of dropping completely in voltage, the distal peaks became irregular and were often lower than the initial peaks for normal flow. The peaks from the 16 trials of distal blockage were averaged after the blockage was induced at 10 seconds.  The overall mean peak in distal blockage is 0.54 Volts. When the distal blockage is induced, fluid is still entering the shunt but cannot leave due to the blockage at the distal catheter.

	  </figure>
	  <p class="left"><br>
	    Over the 8 to 16 trials of each condition, overall averages and variances were calculated through peak analysis. Figure 9 and Figure 10 show these results, respectively. An offset of 0.5 Volts was used for the average voltage to prevent negative values.
    </p>
    
	  <p class="left">
	    Overall, this project demonstrated statistically significant results for all tests.  Tests 1 and 2 initially proved feasibility of the design.  Tests 3-5 were the more important tests, demonstrating the viability of this technique.   The null hypothesis (that there would be no difference between blockages in terms of voltage) was rejected with a two sample t-test.  This shows that there is a statistically significant difference for both proximal and distal blockages.
    </p>
    
	  <p class="left">
	    Distal blockage is the most irregular of the blockages. It is theorized that this is because in distal blockage, some fluid flow is still occurring inside the reservoir.  But due to the obstruction, there is more turbulence in the fluid within the shunt, creating the irregular voltage spikes. This is why the distal blockage average voltage (0.54 Volts) is between the normal flow average voltage (0.63 Volts) and the proximal blockage average voltage (0.49 Volts). It was possible to differentiate behaviorally between both blockages just from the initial raw data (see appendix A). These distinct behavioral differences strongly suggest that this device could be shrunk and isolated for use in hospital settings.
    </p>
    
	  <p class="left">
	    The proposed hypothesis for the highest average peak voltage in normal flow is that fluid is able to travel in and out of the shunt, causing the most amount of displacement and thus, the highest peak voltages. The lowest variance is that of the proximal blockage because there is no fluid flowing through the shunt reservoir and thus, there are almost negligible displacements. The proximal blockage average voltage is roughly 0.5 Volts due to the offset induced.
    </p>
    
	  <a name="Synopsis"></a><h2 class="content">Synopsis</h2>
	    <ul id="bullets" class="content">
	      Although there are distinct behaviors between proximal and distal blockages, moving forward towards a clinical usage of interferometry is still a challenge. The results yielded from our experiments were under ideal conditions. The angle between the components of the interferometer were always at a 90 degree angle, making it easy to collect these signals. But, this will not always be the case especially if the patient moves during data collection. The VP shunt was not tested with artificial skin and therefore it is unclear if this particular interferometer device can detect shunt blockages under the skin. Another limitation of this device is the high flow rate of fluid through the shunt. The flow rate during experimentation was faster than physiological flow. This may cause a change in signal behavior. The concept of interferometry to detect shunt failure is feasible, but would require much more testing and alterations to the setup to make it a more stable and effective method.
